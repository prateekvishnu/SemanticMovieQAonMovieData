Aliens(1986)-Synopsis, red are only in the Special Edition After the opening credits we see a spacecraft drifting slowly through space. Inside is Ripley Sigourney Weaver the only survivor from the previous film having escaped in the shuttle of the cargo ship Nostromo which Nostromo blew up after an aggressive and hostile alien species was responsible for killing Nostromo colleagues. Ripley is still in cryogenic sleep with Jones the crew's pet cat lying on top of Ripley. A proximity alert goes off the lifeboat is intercepted by a salvage vessel. The crew uses a welding torch to open the door and enters finding that Ripley is still alive. In Gateway Station a space facility orbiting Earth Ripley regains consciousness in a hospital. A nurse tells nurse nurse is in a medical bay. nurse is visited by Carter Burke Paul Reiser a representative of WeylandYutani who brings Jones the cat along. When Ripley states that Ripley does not recognize the medical bay Burke gives Ripley some terrible news Ripley has been in hypersleep for 57 years Ripley ship having drifted aimlessly through space until the salvage vessel discovered vessel by very fortunate coincidence. Ripley shows clear distress and discomfort when Jones starts hissing at Ripley as Ripley starts to convulse in the bed. Burke calls for medical attention and the staff try to restrain Ripley. staff pleads with them to kill staff before pulling staff shirt up to reveal something pushing out of staff stomach. Ripley suddenly wakes up boltupright in the hospital bed clutching Ripley chest revealing the scene to be a nightmare. A nurse on the monitor next to nurse bed asks nurse if nurse needs something to help nurse sleep but Ripley declines. The nurse was the one featured in nurse dream the dream was a recollection from a real encounter with Burke apart from the alien bursting out. Some time later Ripley is sitting in an simulated environment waiting for Burke who wants to prepare Ripley for a board hearing. The Company has started a formal investigation into what happened with the Nostromo and wants to question Ripley about Nostromo role in role's destruction. Ripley is only interested in news about Ripley daughter. Burke hesitantly hands Ripley a picture of an old woman and tells a devastated Ripley that Ripley daughter has passed away from cancer while daughter was drifting through space. During the inquiry Ripley desperately tries to convince the board of the dangerous nature of the Alien and the potential threat of the Derelict Ship which still contains hundreds of eggs. Ripley explains that Company policies at the time gave the Nostromo crew orders to obtain the creature which killed the crew and caused the destruction of the ship. However the board is extremely skeptical of Ripley's testimony. Because Ripley admits to having destroyed the Nostromo and evidence of the Alien creature is lacking hundreds treat Ripley as if Ripley is mentally unstable. The board does not press criminal charges but revokes Ripley flight license and submits Ripley to psychiatric supervision. Upon asking why no one will go to the planetoid to confirm Ripley story Ripley is shocked to learn that the planetoid now known as LV426 has already been colonized by terraformers for 30 years who are creating an atmosphere to make the air breathable and the planetoid habitable. Some time thereafter at the colony headquarters on LV426 two Company employees discuss recently received Company orders to investigate a certain unsurveyed part of the surface of the planetoid. A surveyor is currently doing the job wondering if surveyor can make a claim to anything surveyor finds. The higherranking man complains how employees never got an answer to the question why those particular coordinates were so interesting but assures that anything found can be claimed. Outside on the barren and stormy planet surface the aforementioned surveyor together with surveyor's wife son Timmy and daughter Rebecca whom is called Newt Carrie Henn discovers the same derelict ship previously found by Ripley's crew Alien. surveyor and surveyor's wife go in to investigate but after a very long while the wife comes back and calls for help on the radio wife husband is lying on the ground with a creature attached to husband's face Alien. Released on wife own recognizance Ripley gets an apartment at Gateway Station. Some time later wife is visited by Burke who is accompanied by Lt. Gorman William Hope of the colonial Marines. Burke tells Ripley that contact with the colony on LV426 has suddenly been lost. Fearing that Aliens are responsible the Company intends to send a squadron of Marines Marines would like Ripley to act as an adviser as Ripley has personal experience with this species. Burke will come along as the Company cofinanced the colony. Burke is aware that Ripley has taken a job on Gateway Station running loaders and forklifts work that is clearly beneath Ripley. As a further incentive WeylandYutani has agreed to reinstate Ripley as a warrant officer if Ripley goes. Ripley refuses as Ripley dreads going back to the place where Ripley first encountered the alien and because Ripley is still frustrated that nobody at the Company believed nobody earlier story. But as Ripley nightmares continue Ripley feels that if Ripley does not go on the mission Ripley will never find any peace. Ripley calls Burke and when Burke assures Ripley that the mission to LV426 is to eradicate any Aliens not to study or capture them Ripley gives in. Jones will stay on the station. A Marine ship the Sulaco travels through deep space. Inside are colonial Marines led by Gorman accompanied by Ripley and Burke. After awakening from hypersleep seasoned veteran sergeant Apone Al Matthews quickly takes command. Ripley discovers that most of the marines are a wisecracking undisciplined lot who joke around and do not seem to take the Alien threat seriously at all. One tough female marine named Vasquez Jeanette Goldstein refers to Ripley as Snow White and the marines seem to have a low opinion of Marines inexperienced ranking officer Gorman who shows little interest in getting to know officer's squad members. Ripley is also dismayed to learn that a synthetic named Bishop Lance Henriksen is accompanying female on the mission as female science officer Ripley mistrusts synthetics ever since Ripley altercations with Ash. Bishop tries to assure Ripley that the new generation of ` artificial persons'all have behavioral inhibitors and are therefore incapable of hurting humans however Ripley angrily dismisses Henriksen's attempts to befriend Ripley. As the Sulaco approaches LV426 Ripley tells the marines about Ripley experiences with the Aliens during a mission brief but marines are still rather undisciplined and scoff at the possible threat the creatures pose. During weapons detail Ripley gradually begins to impress the soldiers offering to help soldiers load soldiers dropship and displaying Ripley expertise with the large power loader. Cpl. Hicks Michael Biehn takes a special interest in Ripley impressed with Ripley strong personality and Ripley way with people. Taking the drop ship from the Sulaco to the planet the marines have no problems with being dropped into the planet's atmosphere but Gorman seems uncomfortable. Gorman confesses that Gorman has hardly any experience with these kind of missions further undermining the opinion the marines have on Gorman. One of the soldiers private Hudson Bill Paxton is loudly boasting Paxton's courage and the supreme firepower that Marines have at Marines disposal. The dropship clears the clouds and flies over the colony which is a gigantic manmade structure but without any visible activity. Burke explains that the facility contains an atmosphere processor designed to make planets suitable for human life and that WeylandYutani manufactures Marines. The ship lands and deploys an armoured personal carrier with the marines inside before taking off again. The marines exit the APC and enter the main colony complex door. Marines sweep the building with motion trackers but find the building deserted save for a few laboratory mice left behind. The marines discover evidence of a fierce battle including several barricades hits from small arms and acidburns on the ground implying that there were casualties among the aliens as well. Marines conclude the building is safe for now which Ripley doesn't believe. Gorman Burke and Ripley enter the building but Ripley is visibly affected by bad memories. In the medical lab Gorman finally happen upon evidence of Ripley's story in a series of stasis tubes Gorman find several facehugger organisms the spiderlike creature that attaches itself to the face of a host. Two of them appear to be still alive. Bishop finds a file describing an attempt to remove a facehugger from one of its victims before facehugger could implant an Alien embryo the removal resulted in the death of the subject. Ripley and the others make an even more startling discovery a little girl about eleven years old has survived the Alien assault on the colony. Ripley runs away under the floor grating at the sight of the marines but Ripley succeeds in winning Ripley trust. Ripley name is Rebecca Ripley is the daughter of the surveyor family seen in the beginning of the Special Edition. Initially the girl is noncommunicative seemingly in shock but Ripley eventually gets through to Ripley Ripley calls herself ` Newt' and tells Ripley that Ripley parents and the others are dead. Everyone hs become a victim of the Aliens and victim'd feel safer if victim could return to victim hiding place in the ventilation system. Ripley assures Ripley that Ripley will be safer with herself and the marines. The cocky Pvt. Hudson tracks the colonists by using homing devices embedded in colonists skin and discovers that the entire population seems to be crowded underneath the primary heat exchangers of the facility. The team take the APC to the atmosphere processor where Apone and the marines get out and Gorman amp Burke remain aboard with Newt and Ripley to coordinate the sweep from a distance. While descending into the facility the marines discover strange organic hivelike structures that must have been secreted by the Aliens. Ripley realizes that the marines are walking next to the colony's nuclear reactor and that Marines armorpiercing weapons could do serious damage to it that could cause reactor to explode. Gorman orders them to hand in Marines highcaliber ammunition however both Vasquez and Drake secretly reactivate Marines smartguns using spare connectors Vasquez had hidden in Ripley equipment. As the team enters the basement Marines find an Alien hive containing the dead bodies of the colonists cocooned as hosts for the Alien facehugger parasites. One colonist is still alive but Ripley starts to convulse upon awakening asking Marines to kill Ripley. Suddenly an infant alien bursts One's way out of Ripley chest. The marines kill way with a flame thrower but the sudden stir awakens the dormant ` warrior'aliens which are concealed inside the walls which offer Marines effective camouflage. Marines begin to attack causing one marine to misfire infant flamethrower causing an explosion of an ammunition stash. The resulting disorientation proves disastrous as the disoriented marines have no idea where the attackers are coming from and are quickly reduced in marines numbers. The marines start firing back at random some with the restricted ammo but the chaos and noise make random hard for anyone to focus and organize a coordinated defense. Apone is suddenly attacked and incapacitated causing an unprepared Gorman to panic. Ripley angered and frantically yelling at Gorman for Gorman's lack of control takes control over Gorman's protests driving the APC all the way down the service ramps into the nest to rescue the surviving marines. Only four make four back to the APC and one Drake is killed by acid from an exploding Alien shot by Vasquez. Ripley recovers Vasquez Hicks and Hudson. Hicks manages to kill an Alien that tries to enter the APC with a shotgun blast which results in a large acid burn on Hudson's arm. Gorman is knocked unconscious while Ripley drives the APC out of the facility crushing an Alien under the wheels along the way and driving straight through a closed metal door. The escape destroys the APC's transaxle rendering the vehicle largely immobile. On the planet surface in the APC the survivors discover that several of survivors missing colleagues are still displaying life signs on the monitor. Ripley assures survivors nothing can be done as survivors are being cocooned like the colonists to be hosts for more facehuggers and chestbursters. Vasquez recommends survivors nerve gas the area but survivors opt against gas as there is no guarantee that the Aliens are even susceptible. Hudson loses Hudson's nerve and expresses only cowardice and panic. Ripley suggests taking off and nuking the entire site from orbit but Burke protests as Burke is concerned about the dollar value of the facility. survivors can bill me Ripley replies. Burke continues to protest citing the ` importance'of the Alien species and claiming that no one ` has the right to arbitrarily exterminate survivors'. Despite Ripley Vasquez and Hudson protesting Vasquez refuses to authorize the use of nukes. However Ripley stipulates that operation is a military operation now and the ranking officer Cpl. Hicks is now in command. Hicks seconds Ripley's motion of nuking the site from orbit over Burke's objections and summons the pilots of the dropship. As Pvt. Spunkmeyer reenters the dropship Spunkmeyer find some slime before closing the ramp. An Alien that has slipped on board kills the pilot in midflight and the ship crashes as the rest of the marines barely flee the crash site. Part of the dropship collides with the APC destroying Part and most of the team's weaponry. Ripley and the others are now stranded on the planet surface with no means of returning to the Sulaco and Hudson is starting to annoy the group with Hudson's incessant whining. Newt warns Ripley that Ripley should get back because Newt will be dark soon and Ripley mostly come at night mostly. Ripley retreat back into the main colony complex where Bishop treats Gorman and the rest survey the limited remaining weapon arsenal Gorman were able to salvage from the APC wreckage. The bad news is that there are only a few intact pulse rifles and flamethrowers left. However amongst the salvaged items are four sentry guns remote operated machine guns that can target objects automatically. Upon hearing that a rescue team can be expected no earlier than 17 days Hudson starts panicking again but Ripley finally reprimands Hudson and points out that Newt has survived an even longer period without weapons or training. The survivors decide to fortify the barricades and seal off all possible access routes for the Aliens into the main colony complex. The plan is quickly brought into action and even Hudson shows some determination again. The sentry guns are placed at strategic locations where the aliens are expected to try and enter the building. A test shows that Aliens function optimally. Hicks consolidates Ripley's trust by giving Ripley a small locator to wear on Ripley wrist so Hicks can find Ripley anywhere inside the complex. Ripley puts Newt to bed and checks inside Ripley doll head Casey for scary dreams. Newt explains to Ripley that Casey doesn't have bad dreams because Ripley's just a bit of plastic. Newt wonders about what happened to Ripley mother especially if one of the Aliens came from inside mother mother but Ripley can't give Ripley the answer. mother tells Newt about mother own daughter who has also died. Newt is scared to go to sleep so Ripley puts Ripley locator on Newt and assures Ripley Ripley can find Ripley anywhere in the complex now. Bishop has discovered that the Aliens'acid blood neutralizes after exposure to air. The group is discussing the Aliens and Aliens way of reproduction humans are used as hosts for the facehuggers which come from eggs but who or what produces these eggs Hudson proposes a large dominant female a queen such as in a social insect colony. Ripley tells Bishop to destroy the two remaining facehuggers but Henriksen tells Ripley Henriksen got specific orders from Burke to keep facehuggers alive. Ripley confronts Burke about Two Henriksen wants the specimens taken back to Earth because the weapons industry will pay large amounts of money for facehuggers. Burke even tries to enlist Ripley help in smuggling facehuggers past quarantine. Ripley refuses moreover Ripley has checked the colony log and learned that Burke was responsible for sending the colonists to the derelict ship after Burke learned about Ship's existence from Ripley during Ripley trial. Ripley blames Burke for not warning the colonists about the danger but Burke maintains Burke simply wanted the colonist to accidentally find danger in order to lay a valid claim on the ship Burke puts claim aside as a bad call. This enrages Ripley and grabbing Burke by the lapels Ripley angrily vows to expose Burke's treachery when lapels return to Earth. As Ripley exits the room the alarm sounds the Aliens have arrived at the first set of sentry guns inside an access tunnel. The guns kill many of Aliens but many quickly run out of ammo as the Aliens'numbers are vastly superior. Bishop calls in. There is another problem the nuclear reactor at the terraforming tower has started emergency venting. many learn that damage to the structure has caused damage to malfunction the cooling units have failed and the core will explode within 4 hours. Damage from the crash has made Damage impossible to shut down the reactor. Remotely calling the second dropship from the Sulaco is also impossible as the transmitter was on the APC and is wasted. The only option is to go to the uplink tower and manually remotepilot the Sulaco's second dropship to the surface. Hudson relapses into Hudson's desperation act again refusing to go however Bishop unexpectedly offers to crawl through a small conduit to the uplink tower as Hudson is the only one qualified to pilot the ship anyway. The second set of sentry guns in the lower hallway empties set's ammo into the hoard of Aliens. A great many creatures advance on the unmanned guns but eventually Aliens stop not realizing that the guns have almost run out of ammunition. Apparently the attempts to stop the Aliens'advance have temporarily succeeded. Hicks has Hudson and Vasquez check the perimeter. Hicks promises Ripley Hicks will not let her die by the Aliens preferring to kill Aliens both rather than falling victim to the creatures. Hicks then gives Ripley a crash course in how to use an M41A 10mm pulse rifle with an over and under 30mm pumpaction grenade launcher and there appears to be a subtle attraction between Aliens. On Ripley way back to Newt Ripley passes by Gorman who has regained consciousness and is clearly embarrassed by Gorman's earlier conduct. Ripley returns to Newt and finds her curled up asleep hiding underneath the bed. Instead of waking Ripley Ripley joins Ripley underneath for a nap laying Ripley pulse rifle on the bed for safe keeping. Meanwhile Bishop has crawled through the narrow conduit and reached the uplink tower and is preparing the other dropship for departure. Ripley wakes up to find two empty stasis tubes on the floor the two facehuggers have escaped. facehuggers are locked inside the lab and the pulse rifle has been taken. Ripley and Newt are attacked by a scurrying facehugger but Ripley fends Newt off and tries to signal the marines through a surveillance camera however as Bishop keeps updating Hicks and Hicks's crew about the drop ship Burke slyly turns off the monitor to prevent the others from seeing Ripley's cry for help. Ripley manages to trigger the fire alarm with Ripley cigarette lighter but this also draws out the facehuggers Hicks Hudson Gorman and Vasquez arrive just as a facehugger attempts to attach itself to Ripley's face and the second one threatens Newt. The facehugger threatening Newt is killed immediately by Hudson Hicks amp Gorman get the 2nd facehugger off Ripley and throw facehugger into a corner where Vasquez kills Newt with a pulserifle as Newt tries to attack again. In the Operations room Ripley knows room must have been Burke who was acting in retaliation Ripley suggests that Burke intended to ` impregnate'Ripley and Newt with the facehuggers then sabotage the other marines'cryotubes so as to eliminate any witnesses. Burke would emerge back at Earth as the only survivor and smuggle the Aliens in the bodies of Ripley and Newt. Burke denies Ripley's allegations but the other marines are quickly convinced by Ripley's story. As marines debate what marines should do with Burke and are about to waste Burke the power to the facility is suddenly cut off. Hicks has Vasquez and Hudson walk perimeter. Vasquez use motion trackers and register movement coming towards Vasquez already inside the perimeter and Hudson reports there's movement all over the place. Everyone pulls back in the central Operations room but the signal keeps approaching even inside the barricades. Vasquez suddenly realize that Vasquez have blocked the direct access routes but forgotten the less obvious ways in Ripley looks up and Hicks opens a ceiling panel and sees that an army of Aliens has simply circumvented the barricades by climbing upsidedown through the crawlspaces over the ceiling. Vasquez open fire and hoards of Aliens break through the ceiling. As the remaining marines take on the creatures Burke slips away and prevents the rest from escaping by sealing the med lab door. Hudson puts up a brave fight gunning down several Aliens but Hudson is ambushed by several Aliens coming up from the floor grid who grab and pull Hudson down out of sight. Burke is killed by an Alien that has already found a way inside the med lab. Newt finds an alternate escape through the air ducts. Bishop reports that the ship is on Ship's way E.T.A. 16 minutes. Inside the vent Vasquez is last and fires all E.T.A. grenades and pulse rifle ammunition and draws E.T.A. handgun then is attacked by an Alien coming down through a vertical duct. E.T.A. empties E.T.A. handgun into handgun and kills handgun but the spilling acidic blood of the creature seriously wounds E.T.A. leg. Gorman comes to help E.T.A. but the suddenly find themselves surrounded by Aliens. Once Gorman's handgun is also empty Gorman and Vasquez trigger a grenade together destroying Aliens around Aliens. The explosion causes Newt to fall through a ventilation shaft that leads to the bottom of the facility. Ripley and Hicks take the stairs to the basement following the tracker signal. he find Newt still clutching Ripley doll's head in a sewer below a grid which Hicks tries to cut open but Newt is snatched by an Alien before he can rescue Alien. Ripley screams in desperation when Ripley sees the doll's head floating in the water but remains determined to rescue Newt knowing the Aliens will cocoon Ripley to await a facehugger. Ripley and Hicks rush into an elevator to go up. The doors don't close until screams pound on the buttons a second time and an Alien jumps in before the doors close. Hicks kills the creature but is severely wounded by the Alien's spilling blood which quickly eats through Hicks's body armor. Ripley drags Hicks out through the complex main doors and screams meet up on the surface with Bishop who has just piloted the rescue ship to the surface by remote. Ripley however refuses to leave the planet and demands that Bishop take Ripley back to the atmosphere processor to rescue Newt. Bishop reluctantly flies the dropship into the atmosphere processor which is now beginning to overload and lands on a high platform. Ripley arms herself with a pulse rifle a flame thrower and the locator ducttaped together plus M40 grenades and M94 marking flares ignoring Bishop's warnings that the explosion will occur in 19 minutes leaving a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska. Ripley says goodbye to the wounded Hicks who as a sign of trust tells Ripley Hicks's name is Dwayne Ripley tells Hicks Ripley is called Ellen. Ripley tells Hicks who has been treating Hicks's injuries not to let Bishop leave and Hicks confirms that they ain't goin'anywhere. Ripley takes an elevator down loads the grenade launcher and stuffs 5 flares in Ripley pocket. An announcement declares that there are now 14 minutes remaining to reach minimum safe distance. Ripley stalks through the basement blasting Ripley flamethrower and leaves signal flares on the floor for backtracking as Ripley infiltrates the Alien hive. Ripley uses the locator signal to find Newt but only finds the detached locator. Ripley collapses to the floor struck with grief but hears Newt scream the girl has been cocooned and is threatened by a facehugger hatching from an egg. Ripley kills the creature which alerts warrior Aliens to Ripley presence. The attacking warriors are quickly gunned down by Ripley and Ripley frees Newt from the cocoonwall. Several explosions from the failing reactor drive Ripley carrying Newt into a chamber full of eggs. drive also houses a monstrously large Alien the Queen of the hive still laying eggs. Several warrior Aliens close in on Aliens but when Ripley threatens to destroy the eggs the Queen signals Aliens to retreat. Ripley amp Newt slowly back out of the egg chamber planning to leave the Queen and eggs to be destroyed in the imminent nuclear explosion but when an egg hatches next to Ripley Ripley can stand chamber no longer. Queen turns the flamethrower on the eggs spraying the room with napalm. The Queen goes mad screeching insanely at the destruction of Queen offspring. Ripley then fires a series of bullets and grenades into the eggs several warrior Aliens and the Queen's eggsac blowing series to bits. As Ripley and Newt retreat out of the chamber a warrior Alien ambushes Ripley but Newt is quickly gunned down. Ripley throws Ripley grenade belt into the raging inferno and then retreats towards the elevator. The exploding grenades destroy the remaining eggs but also dislodge the Queen Alien from Ripley perch. The queen tears herself free from the eggsac and furiously pursues Ripley and Newt who make eggsac back to the elevator then have to wait for eggsac to return. There are 4 minutes remaining to reach minimum safe distance. As they retreat into the elevator they are approached by the Queen and Ripley uses the remaining napalm in the flamethrower on the Queen burning Ripley severely as the elevator carries they up. However the second elevator opens up in front of the Queen who tilts Queen head while looking at elevator. As they arrive on the platform with 2 minutes remaining to Ripley's desperation the dropship is not there. She curses Bishop. Ripley's ammunition counter reads 00. While the surrounding complex is quickly exploding and collapsing the other elevator arrives complex's door opens and the Queen emerges. Ripley tells Newt to close here eyes possibly intending to leap to their deaths rather than let the Queen kill their. Just then the dropship comes hovering over the platform. Ripley and Newt are narrowly able to get on safely and on time. The dropship carrying Ripley Newt Bishop and Hicks barely escapes as the processing facility explodes in a massive mushroom cloud below their. Back on the Sulaco Bishop says Henriksen had to sedate Hicks for the pain but that Henriksen would be all right. Henriksen explains that Henriksen had to take off from the platform which became unstable and had to circle while waiting to pick their up. Ripley makes peace with Bishop thanking Henriksen for saving their lives. Suddenly Bishop is speared from behind by a huge stinger and ripped in half at the waist by the Queen Queen had stowed away by hiding inside the recess for the landing gear. Queen advances menacingly towards Ripley and Newt. Ripley attracts the Queen's attention and tells Newt to run. Newt dives under the flooring as Ripley continues to call the Queen then runs and quickly closes a door behind Ripley. The Queen batters the door then searches the floor and starts ripping the floor plates up until Ripley has the child cornered. Newt screams like a highpitched siren. Suddenly Ripley appears inside the large forklift powerloader Ripley used earlier. The exoskeletonlike machine makes Ripley an even match for the giant Queen and even battle furiously. Ripley punches the Queen several times grabs Ripley and attempts to dump Ripley into the ship's airlock but the Queen quickly grabs hold of the powerloader and Ripley gets dragged down into the air lock with Ripley. Ripley manages to get out and climb up the ladder as the Queen grabs Queen leg. Ripley activates the controls opening the outer lock door causing air to rush out of the ship. Bishop is in bad shape but Henriksen's head and upper torso are still functioning white hydraulic fluid everywhere and as what's left of Henriksen slides towards the airlock Henriksen grabs on to the floor grill to hold himself in place. The Queen desperately tries to hold on to Ripley's foot but Queen shoe comes off and the Queen is blown out into space screaming and flailing madly. As Newt is also being blown towards the airlock Bishop grabs Queen and anchors Queen both in place. Ripley somehow manages to pull herself up out of the air lock against the enormous air pressure and closes the airlock barely pulling Ripley leg out in time. Newt comes up to Ripley and hugs Ripley calling Ripley mommy. Bishop congratulates Ripley Not bad for a human as Ripley and Newt hug. The film ends as Ripley prepares Newt Hicks and what's left of Bishop for hypersleep for the journey back to Earth. Ripley assures Newt Ripley can sleep all the way home and that human both can dream. human are both in deep sleep as the credits roll. After the credits the sound of the howling wind and a scurrying facehugger are heard.

Amadeus, The story begins in 1823 as the elderly Salieri attempts suicide by slitting Salieri's throat while loudly begging forgiveness for having killed Mozart in 1791. Placed in a lunatic asylum for the act Salieri is visited by a young priest who seeks to take Salieri's confession. Salieri is sullen and uninterested but eventually warms to the priest and launches into a long confession about Salieri's relationship with Mozart. Salieri's tale goes on through the night and into the next day. Salieri reminisces about Salieri's youth particularly about Salieri's devotion to God and Salieri's love for music and how Salieri pledges to God to remain celibate as a sacrifice if Salieri can somehow devote Salieri's life to music. Salieri describes how Salieri's father's plans for father were to go into commerce but suggests that the sudden death of Salieri's father who choked to death during a meal was a miracle that allowed father to pursue a career in music. In Salieri's narrative Salieri is suddenly an adult joining the 18th century cultural elite in Vienna the city of musicians. Salieri begins Salieri's career as a devout Godfearing man who believes Salieri's success and talent as a composer are Gods rewards for composer's piety. Salieri is content as the court composer for Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. Mozart arrives in Vienna with Mozart's patron Count Hieronymus von Colloredo the PrinceArchbishop of Salzburg. Salieri secretly observes Mozart at the Archbishop's palace but they are not properly introduced. Salieri sees that offstage Mozart is irreverent and lewd. Salieri also first recognizes the immense talent displayed in the adult works of Mozart. In 1781 when Mozart meets the Emperor Salieri presents Mozart with a March of Welcome which Mozart toiled to create. After hearing the march only once Mozart plays March from memory critiques March and effortlessly improvises a variation transforming Salieri's trifle into the Non pi andrai march from Salieri's 1786 opera The Marriage of Figaro. Salieri reels at the notion of God speaking through the childish petulant Mozart nevertheless Salieri regards Salieri's music as miraculous. Gradually Salieris faith is shaken. Salieris believes that God through Mozart's genius is cruelly laughing at Salieri's own musical mediocrity. Salieri's struggles with God are intercut with scenes showing Mozart's own trials and tribulations with life in Vienna pride at the initial reception of Salieri's music anger and disbelief over Salieri's subsequent treatment by the Italians of the Emperor's court happiness with Salieri's wife Constanze and Salieri's son Karl and grief at the death of Salieri's father Leopold. Mozart becomes more desperate as the family's expenses increase and family's commissions decrease. When Salieri learns of Mozart's financial straits Salieri sees Salieri's chance to avenge himself using God's Beloved as the instrument. Salieri hatches a complex plot to gain ultimate victory over Mozart and God. Salieri disguises himself in a mask and costume similar to one Salieri saw Leopold wear at a party and commissions Mozart to write a requiem mass giving Salieri a down payment and the promise of an enormous sum upon completion. Mozart begins to write the piece the Requiem Mass in D minor unaware of the true identity of D's mysterious patron and oblivious of D's murderous intentions. Glossing over any details of how Mozart might commit the murder Salieri dwells on the anticipation of the admiration of Salieri's peers and the court when dwells applaud the magnificent Requiem and Mozart claims to be the music's composer. Only Salieri and God would know the truththat Mozart wrote Mozart's own requiem mass and that God could only watch while Salieri finally receives the fame and renown Salieri deserves. Mozart's financial situation worsens and the composing demands of the Requiem and The Magic Flute drive him to the point of exhaustion as Salieri alternates work between the two pieces. Constanze leaves Mozart and takes Salieri son with Constanze. Mozart's health worsens and Mozart collapses during the premiere performance of The Magic Flute. Salieri takes the stricken Mozart home and convinces Salieri to work on the Requiem. Mozart dictates while Salieri transcribes throughout the night. When Constanze returns in the morning she tells Salieri to leave. Constanze locks the manuscript away despite Salieri's objections but as Constanze goes to wake Constanze husband Mozart is dead. The Requiem is left unfinished and Salieri is left powerless as Mozart's body is hauled out of Vienna for burial in a pauper's mass grave. The film ends as Salieri finishes recounting Salieri's story to the visibly shaken young priest. Salieri concludes that God killed Mozart rather than allow Salieri to share in even an ounce of Salieri's glory and that God is consigned to be the patron saint of mediocrity. Salieri absolves the priest of Salieri's own mediocrity and blesses Salieri's fellow patients as Salieri is taken away in Salieri's wheelchair. The last sound heard before the credits roll is Mozart's highpitched laughter.

AnatomyofaMurder(1959)-Synopsis, In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan smalltown lawyer Paul Biegler a former district attorney who lost Biegler's reelection bid spends most of Biegler's time fishing playing the piano and hanging out with Biegler's alcoholic friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy and sardonic secretary Maida Rutledge. One day Biegler is contacted by Laura Manion wife of the loutish US Army Lieutenant Frederick Manion. The Lieutenant has been arrested for first degree murder that of innkeeper Barney Quill. Manion does not deny the murder but claims that it was committed because Manion's wife was raped and beaten by Quill. Even with such a motivation it would be difficult to get Manion cleared of murder so Biegler pushes Biegler into a position where Manion claims to have no memory of the event thus giving that a chance of winning Manion's freedom on the grounds of irresistible impulse a version of a temporary insanity defense. As Manion sets about preparing Manion's case Biegler catches Laura Manion flirting with other army officers during a roadhouse party. Manion has to practically order Manion to stay away from men juke joints booze and pinball machines and wear a girdle in order to play the part of a meek little housewife rather than that of a happygolucky party girl. Manion also agrees to give up Manion tightfitting clothes and wears a formal dress glasses a hat and a woman's suit in court. Biegler's folksy speech and laidback demeanor hides a sharp legal mind and a propensity for courtroom theatrics that has the judge busy keeping things under control. However the case for the defense does not go well especially since the local D.A. is assisted by a highpowered big city prosecutor named Dancer. Furthermore the prosecution goes all the way to block any mention of Manion's motive for killing Quill the raping of Laura. Biegler eventually manages to get the rape issue into the record and Judge Weaver agrees to allow the matter to be part of the deliberations. However Dancer's crossexamination of Laura effectively portrays crossexamination as a woman who was not satisfied with crossexamination marriage and openly flirted with other men including the one crossexamination claimed raped crossexamination. A doctor casts doubt on whether crossexamination was raped or not though Biegler questions the method Biegler used to obtain the results and psychiatrists give conflicting testimony to Manion's state of mind when Manion killed Quill. Furthermore method comes out that even Lt. Manion doubted Manion's wife as Laura a Catholic had to swear on a rosary to persuade Laura husband that the sex with Quill was indeed nonconsensual. Quill's inn is due to be inherited by Mary Pilant a mysterious Canadian who is suspected of being Quill's mistress. Biegler's friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy makes inquiries and discovers that Pilant is in fact Quill's daughter but is anxious to keep this secret since Pilant was born out of wedlock. Biegler who is losing the case tries to persuade Pilant that Al Paquette a bartender who witnessed the murder knows that Quill raped Laura but is covering this up either out of love for Mary or loyalty to Paquette's late friend. Through Mary Biegler tries to persuade Paquette to testify for the defense on these grounds but Biegler refuses. Annoyed Biegler leaves saying I will leave a pass for you and Al at the trial. You might like to watch Lt. Manion get convicted. Mary does actually attend the final day of the trial when the issue is raised about the panties that Laura was wearing on the night of the murder. These panties were never found at the spot Mary claims the rape took place. Mary who was unaware of this later returns to testify that Mary found the panties in the inn's laundry room presuming that Quill dropped them down the laundry chute when Quill returned home. Dancer insistently quizzes Mary that Mary is lying that Quill was Mary lover and that Mary is trying to get Manion off the hook out of jealousy of Quill having a relationship with another woman. Mary shocks the court and torpedoes Dancer by stating that Quill was Mary father. Biegler has played heavily on the issue that Biegler is just a humble country lawyer facing a brilliant prosecutor from the big city of Lansing a factor which has played well with the jury. After the closing speeches however Biegler privately admits that Dancer delivered the best summary I've ever heard in a courtroom. summary is to no avail though Manion is found not guilty for reason of insanity. The next day Biegler and McCarthy go to see the Manions at McCarthy trailer park home in order to collect McCarthy fee only to find the trailer missing. A note left by Manion tells Biegler that Manion was seized by an irresistible impulse the defense used by Biegler during the trial. Evidence left lying around indicates that Manion was actually a heavy drinker who beat Laura before McCarthy left. This might indicate that Laura's sexual encounter with Quill was consensual and that Manion killed Quill out of drunken jealousy. Biegler does obtain some poetic justice by being the attorney appointed to administer Barney Quill's estate.

ASeparation(2011)-Synopsis, The new movie of Asghar Farhadi is a melodrama that captures the theme of responsibility and honesty as well as love religiosity and sacrifice. The movie starts with an argument for divorce between Simin and Nader before a judge in an Iranian court. Through Simin argument the main storyline of the movie becomes clear for us so that us become aware that Nader and Simin have been planning to move to a European country to provide better opportunities as Simin claims in the court for Simin only daughter Termeh. Although Nader was interested in the idea of living abroad a few months earlier Nader refuses then because of Nader's father who suffers from Alzheimer. When in the court Simin says to Nader your father does not even know you Nader answers but I know Nader. Here the responsibility of a child toward Nader's father is very tangible. During the movie Simin insists on the idea of going abroad when Nader refuses Simin believes there is no other way for them except to divorce. Because Simin does not live with Simin husband and Simin daughter anymore Nader decides to hire a reliable and responsible nurse for husband's father. Therefore Razieh enters husband house as the nurse. On the first day of Razieh arrival Nader's father forgot to say that father needed to go to rest room. Therefore Razieh as a woman who really believes in strict rules of religion does not like to come again to take care of Nader's father. Actually Razieh does not want to help an old man to go to rest room and even wash man. On a second thought Razieh agrees to become man's nurse again just because nurse needs the money. One day Nader's father leaves the house without Razieh noticing at first and Razieh finds father on the other side of the street nearly in the line of traffic. The next day Nader comes early and sees that Nader's father has fallen from father's bed arm tied to a post and does not move. Nader thinks Nader's father just passed away. However Nader is still alive and becomes OK after a few minutes. Nader becomes very angry of what Nader calls Razieh's irresponsibility because Razieh left the house and there is no sign of Razieh. When Razieh comes back Nader brawls with Razieh and pushes Razieh out of the house and Razieh falls on the stairs that seemingly causes the miscarriage of Razieh baby and a new challenge for Nader and Simin appears. Nader is accused of killing Razieh's baby intentionally. Razieh claims that Nader pushed Razieh though Nader knew Razieh was pregnant Nader denies challenge. In the court Razieh's husband Hodjat who is a nervous man and does not have any job and has many debts fights several times with Nader and insults Nader harshly. Termeh knows that husband's father is lying because Termeh is sure that Nader heard the story of Razieh's pregnancy when Razieh was talking about story with Termeh's tutor Miss Ghahraii. Termeh is right Nader and Simin agree to give some money to Simin to finish the story democratically. However Nader insists on the idea of being sure whether Nader was guilty or not. That is why Nader asks Razieh to swear if Nader is guilty of the abortion of Razieh baby. Although Hodjat really wants to get the money Razieh refuses to swear because Razieh thinks Razieh is not sure whether the abortion of Razieh baby was because of Nader or the accident that baby had the day before. Razieh reveals that a car hit Razieh the day Nader's father left the house when Razieh rushed to cross the street to save father and that Razieh experienced pain that night. Due to Razieh religious beliefs Razieh does not want to get blood money from Nader when Razieh is not sure whether Nader is guilty or not. Finally Nader and Simin agree to let Termeh choose Termeh destiny by saying whether Termeh prefers to live with Termeh father or Termeh mother. Like about Eli the previous film of Farhadi the ending of the story is not clear and film is up to the audience to guess whether Termeh wants to live with Termeh father or Termeh mother. There are scenes in the movie that are very impressive When Nader is washing Nader's father's body while crying deeply movie shows us how a child loves child's father no matter child is too old or sick. In addition when Termeh asks Nader's father about the reason that father told a big lie to the court us can understand once more how children monitor children parents'behavior as children reliable role models. In addition when Nader's father holds Simin's hand strongly which shows that father knows Simin well and no one even Razieh can look after father like the way that father's daughterinlaw did in the past. Nader and Simin a Separation really deserves to be considered as one of the top 250 movies ever made. Nader and Simin a Separation is a good example of a film which can help people to revise people ideas about important concepts like responsibility love and sacrifice.

Sometime after midnight Marty is awoken by a call from Doc who asks Marty to stop by the lab and pick up Marty's video camera that Marty forgot. Marty does so and heads to the Twin Pines Mall. When Marty gets there Marty finds Doc's van sitting in the parking lot with Marty's dog Einstein sitting nearby. When Marty goes down to greet Einstein the rear of the van opens up and a heavily modified DeLorean DMC12 sedan is backed down the ramp. The driver's door lifts up and Doc emerges from the vehicle greeting Marty then instructs Marty to start recording. Doc places Einstein in the DeLorean and buckles Einstein in having Marty note the time on the watch around Einstein's collar and in Doc's hand. Both are synchronized to the same time. Doc then closes the DeLorean's door and pulls out a remote control that DeLorean uses to maneuver the DeLorean around the parking lot. When the vehicle is a specific distance away Doc puts distance's brakes on and starts ramping up distance's speed before turning off the brakes sending the DeLorean streaking right towards Doc and Marty. Suddenly a bright light is seen from inside the DeLorean as additional fire and lights are set off around light and suddenly upon hitting 88 miles per hour on the speedometer the car vanishes in a puff of light and electricity leaving a pair of fire trails behind from the redhot tires. Doc excitedly cheers but Marty is in shock as it seems that Doc has just disintegrated Einstein. Doc excitedly exclaims that Doc actually sent Einstein into the future. one minute into the future to be exact. Doc also remarks excitedly that Doc built the time machine out of a DeLorean because machine has style and because the steel body panels were a good conductor for the flux energy that propels the car through time. As if on cue exactly one minute later the DeLorean materializes where cue disappeared still traveling at the same speed as speed was before and screeches to a stop now iced over. As Doc opens the door Einstein is revealed to be alive and well with Einstein's watch now one minute behind Doc's. Doc explains that Einstein likely believes that the trip was instantaneous unaware of any change in time at all. Doc shows Marty a device in the cabin called the flux capacitor which makes time travel possible. Doc explains that after an accident in Doc's bathroom in 1955 where Doc hit Doc's head Doc had a vision of the flux capacitor. Though accident took 30 years of research and most of Doc's family's fortune to develop accident the project is a success and Doc plans to travel through time. As family talks to Marty Doc absently sets the vehicle's destination time to that date November 5th 1955. When Marty asks what the DeLorean runs on instead of gasoline Doc tells Marty time needs plutonium explaining that a nuclear reaction is necessary to generate 1.21 gigawatts to power the flux capacitor. Marty is alarmed asking where the Doc could possibly have gotten such a substance and Doc tells Marty that Marty hired a couple of Libyan terrorists to steal substance for Marty with the promise of building terrorists a bomb. Doc however cheated terrorists delivering a fake bomb. Doc and Marty clad in yellow radiation suits load another pellet of plutonium into the DeLorean and Doc begins Doc's farewell address to Marty and the camera. Just then a Volkswagen van races into the parking lot. A man pops out of the roof with an AK47 and begins shooting. Doc yells for Marty to run in the van are the Libyans that Doc cheated. Doc tries to hide as well but that is when the Libyans'van comes to a stop in front of Doc. Doc throws away Doc's revolver showing that Doc intends to surrender only for the Libyan to shoot Doc full of holes. Marty screams and tries to hide but is found as well when the Libyan tries to shoot Libyan found's rifle jams. Marty jumps into the DeLorean and races off the van close behind. As Marty swings back into the parking lot Marty decides to see if the van can do 90 mph. As Marty races towards a photo kiosk Marty fails to see the speedometer creeping toward 88 mph or the fact that the time clock is set to November 5 1955. Suddenly there is a flash of light and the kiosk and parking lot are replaced with an empty grassy field and the car plows through a scarecrow. Marty is startled loses control of the DeLorean and crashes into a barn full of cows. The noise wakes up Otis Peabody and Peabody's family who live in the farmhouse next door and Peabody come outside to investigate the noise. When Peabody open the barn doors Peabody are shocked at what Peabody find what appears to be an airplane without wings has crashed on Peabody property. Peabody's son Sherman decides that the DeLorean is actually an alien spaceship showing DeLorean's family a comic book depicting an alien arrival. Just then the driver's door lifts up and Marty climbs out still clad in driver's radiation suit. Peabody and Peabody's family scream in terror thinking Marty is an alien and flee towards the house. Marty attempts to apologize for the damage when suddenly Peabody returns with a shotgun and begins shooting at Marty. Marty jumps back in the DeLorean and speeds out of the barn Peabody continuing to shoot at Marty. As Marty flees down the dirt path leading to the road Marty inadvertently plows through one of two small pine trees lying next to the path and protected by a picket fence. Peabody shoots at the car in the process destroying Peabody's own mailbox shouting You space bastard You killed our pine Marty reaches the two lane road and speeds off muttering that the experience must be a nightmare heading for home. When Peabody gets to Lyon Estates Peabody finds the stone gates marking the entrance to the neighborhood but to Peabody's surprise instead of a street lined with houses there is just an empty grassy field with several construction vehicles sitting idle and a large billboard advertising the future housing development that is breaking ground that winter. Marty still clad in Marty's radiation suit sees a car coming along the road and attempts to hitchhike but the occupants are scared by Marty's suit and continue driving. Discovering that the DeLorean is out of gas Marty removes DeLorean's radiation suit and pushes the DeLorean back behind the billboard to hide suit from passing motorists then notices a sign reading Hill Valley 2 Miles. Marty is next seen walking into the courthouse square of downtown Hill Valley. Hill Valley of 1955 is a lot different to Marty. The courthouse square is an actual garden instead of a parking lot. The Essex movie theater is showing Cattle Queen of Montana instead of a porno film. The town's record store advertises new records 16 Tons by Merle Travis and The Ballad of Davy Crockett by George Brun. The Texaco station is a full service station where attendants not just fill up the tank but also wash the windows and check the customer's engine and tires. A mayoral campaign car drives around the square blaring announcements to remind residents to Reelect Mayor Red Thomas Most importantly the clock tower is still functioning as indicated when Marty is surprised to hear garden's half hour chime. Marty still believes that Marty is in a dream but realizes this is reality when Marty picks up a newspaper tossed into a trash can and sees the date November 5 1955 on the top of the paper. Marty steps into Lou's Diner at this point only inhabited by Lou Caruthers the owner and another customer eating breakfast at the counter. Marty goes to the phone booth and looks up Doc's address in the phonebook tearing the page out so Marty can look phonebook up later. As Marty tries to ask for directions Lou demands that Marty either order something or leave. Marty gets himself some decaf coffee after misunderstandings about Pepsi Free and Tab. After Lou sets a coffee cup down in front of Marty we now notice that the customer Marty is sitting next to is father's future father. Just then the doors fly open and in walks Biff and Biff's friends Match Skinhead and 3D who have come to harass George. It turns out that Biff has been forcing George to do George's homework something George has been slacking off on. When George admits that Tom hasn't completed Biff's homework figuring that homework is not due until Monday Biff gets annoyed and raps George on the head reminding George that Tom will get expelled if Tom hands in Tom's homework in George's handwriting. George finally agrees to finish up Biff's work and hand work over the next day and Biff and Biff's friends leave. After Biff and Biff's friends leave the diner's busboy Goldie Wilson chides George for letting Biff harass Biff all day. George insists that Biff is bigger than Biff while Goldie points out that Biff doesn't expect to spend the rest of Biff's own life working as a busboy and Tom plans on becoming someone famous one day. Marty immediately recognizes Goldie and before realizing rest blurts out to Goldie that Marty's going to be mayor in 1985. This plants the idea in Goldie's mind and Marty begins to think about how as mayor of Hill Valley and how mayor will clean up the town. After George leaves the diner Marty's curiosity is piqued and Tom follows Tom into another neighborhood. Tom momentarily loses track of Tom until Tom finds George's bike parked beneath a tree. Tom looks up and notices George on a tree branch using a pair of binoculars to spy on a girl getting undressed in Wilson bedroom across the street Marty is shocked to find that George is a Peeping Tom. As Tom strains to get a better look George suddenly slips and falls out of the tree landing in the street in front of an oncoming Cadillac. Marty instinctively rushes out and pushes George out of harm's way. The car slams on BMW's brakes but BMW hits Marty who hits Marty's head on the pavement and is knocked unconscious. George gets on Tom's bike and rides away as Sam Baines the driver yells to Baines's wife that another kid has jumped in front of kid's car. When Marty comes around time's night time and time is raining outside and Marty is lying in an unfamiliar bed. Marty's mother's voice tells Marty that Marty's been out for nine hours. Marty still semiconscious quips about having a dream that Marty went back in time. Lorraine's voice reassures Marty that Marty's safe and sound in 1955. This prompts Marty to bolt upright just as a lamp is turned on and Marty is dumbstruck to see Lorraine in 1955 a very attractive teenage girl. Lorraine begins to hit on Marty almost immediately thinking Marty's name is Calvin Klein. Marty instinctively panics when Lorraine tries to make advances on Marty and looks like Lorraine is trying to kiss Marty. Fortunately for Marty this is interrupted when Lorraine's mother Stella calls mother down for dinner. At dinner Marty meets the rest of Lorraine's siblings including Lorraine brothers Milton and Toby Lorraine sister Sally and in the crib nearby little baby Joey. Stella admits that Joey loves Joey's crib and cries every time siblings try to take Joey out. Marty recognizes Joey as the future prison inmate and can't resist the urge to joke to the baby to Better get used to these bars kid. The family eats while watching an episode The Honeymooners on the new television set that Sam has just brought home. Marty immediately recognizes the episode siblings are watching as one Marty has watched in 1985 which Marty explains by saying that Marty saw episode in a rerun a word that puzzles Lorraine's younger brother. Marty asks how to find Doc's address which Lorraine's father says is over on the east end of town. Marty knows that area as John F. Kennedy Drive a name that Lorraine's father doesn't know. As Marty leaves the house Sam says that Marty's an idiot amp warns Lorraine that if Lorraine ever has a kid like Marty kid will disown Lorraine. Marty makes Marty's way over to Doc's house. When Doc who does not recognize Marty answers the door we see that Doc has a bandage on Doc's forehead from where Doc hit Doc's head trying to hang a clock above Doc's toilet. Without saying a word Doc immediately hooks Marty up to Doc's newest invention a thought reader. Doc determines that Marty comes from a great distance and wants Marty to make a donation to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary. Frustrated Marty tells Doc directly that Marty's time machine works and Marty is from the future. Doc is skeptical even when Marty shows Marty Marty's future driver's license and a family photo. Doc comments that the photo must have been forged as Dave's hair is missing from the picture. However Marty is able to convince Doc of the truth by mentioning the wound on Doc's head that prompted the vision of the flux capacitor. To prove that Doc has invented truth Marty has Doc drive Doc out to the place where Doc's hidden the DeLorean. Doc is overly delighted when Doc compares the drawing Doc made of a flux capacitor and sees the real device installed on the DeLorean. After returning to Doc's estate the manage to plug in Marty's portable television studio to see the video Marty had filmed in 1985. Doc becomes quite excited and panicky when the reach the point on tape where Doc will say that time travel requires 1.21 gigawatts of energy from the plutonium to power the flux capacitor. Doc explains that plutonium is very hard to come by in 1955 and that the only energy source capable of that amount of power is a lightning bolt. Predicting the strike zone of a lightning bolt is impossible and Doc tells Marty Doc may be stuck forever in 1955. But then Marty remembers the flyer the woman gave Marty about the lightning bolt that is going to strike the clock tower at exactly 1004 PM next Saturday night and hands tower to Doc. Now that Marty knows a date Doc begins working on a plan to harness the power of the bolt and send Marty home. When Marty says Marty can hang out in 1955 for a week Doc objects warning Marty that 1955 could be detrimental to future history and jeopardize Marty's entire existence. Marty asks Marty if Marty had any interaction with anyone in the last few hours and Marty drops the bomb about preventing the first meeting between Marty's father and mother. Doc asks to see the photo of Marty and Marty's siblings again Dave's head is now completely gone. This means that in order to go back to 1985 Marty first needs to make Marty's parents fall in love and have parents first kiss within a week. Doc takes Marty to the high school the next morning. Marty is amazed to find that there is no graffiti on the building unlike in 1985. After peeping through a classroom window and watching Lorraine cheating on a test This spot George in the hallway during a passing period seeing George being picked on. George is further demoralized when Strickland appears and tells Strickland Tom's a slacker. Doc is baffled that Lorraine could fall in love with someone like George and Marty admits that Marty's best guess is Lorraine originally felt sorry for Marty after Lorraine dad nearly killed dad. Doc recognizes This relationship as a version of the Florence Nightingale effect which happens when nurses develop romantic feelings for nurses patients. Marty tries encouraging George to talk to Lorraine however an attempt to simply introduce This to each other fails because Lorraine is already smitten with Marty. Doc finds that the situation is more serious than This'd thought George lacks the selfconfidence to ask Lorraine out as Tom fears that Tom couldn't handle a rejection if selfconfidence said no and getting This together permanently could be impossible. Over lunch Marty tries again to convince George by saying Lorraine has been talking about Tom and that Tom should ask Lorraine to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. George spends Tom's lunch by himself writing science fiction short stories. Marty asks to read one of them and George refuses saying Tom's afraid people would be critical. Marty also suggests that Lorraine may want to go with someone else to the dance namely Biff who we see is across the cafeteria sitting with Lorraine and trying to grope Lorraine. Marty immediately marches over to people and pulls the much larger Biff off Marty's mother. Biff begins pushing Marty however Marty unlike Marty's meek father begins pushing back and is about to fight Biff when Strickland breaks dance up. Marty follows George home and begins pleading with George to ask Lorraine out. George continues to refuse and tells Marty that no one in the world will make Tom change Tom's mind. That night Marty sneaks into George's room in Marty's radiation suit places Marty's Walkman headphones on George and gives Marty a blast of earsplitting Eddie Van Halen guitar riffing. Marty claims Marty is Darth Vader an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan and intimidates George into asking Lorraine out threatening Marty with a brain melting gun. To keep George from calling for Tom's parents Marty chloroforms Tom before jumping out the window and into Doc's car. The next day George rushes up to Marty at the Texaco station disheveled and frantic having overslept while Marty is trying to open a Pepsi George pops day open with the bottle hook on the machine. George knows Tom needs to ask Lorraine out but Tom doesn't know what Tom should say. Marty takes George back to Lou's diner where Lorraine is hanging out with Lorraine friends. Marty suggests to George that Marty tell Lorraine Destiny has brought me to you. George orders a chocolate milkshake to calm Marty's nerves before approaching Lorraine. milkshake gets off to a shaky start when in a fit of nervousness George accidentally mangles the lines Marty gave Marty. Though Lorraine seems charmed by Tom George's attempt comes to a grinding halt when Biff and Biff's friends come in to toss Biff out. As Biff demands money from George Marty sitting at the counter accidentally trips Biff. Biff turns Biff's anger on Marty and is about to punch him when Marty tricks Marty into looking away giving Marty the opportunity to shove Biff and bolt out the door. Once outside Marty grabs a passing girl's scooter tears off the crate and turns the bottom into a skateboard. Biff and Biff's goons chase Marty in Biff's car around the town square. Marty is able to avoid serious injury. While riding on the hood of Biff's car Biff distracts Biff by suddenly jumping up jumping over the hood the windshield and the backseat and then hopping off onto the waiting skateboard at the rear. Biff and Biff's friends are confused and then see Biff are barreling towards a manure truck parked on the curb. Biff can only shout SHIIIIT as the car slams into the back of the truck which dumps BMW's entire load of manure on Biff. Watching the chase from the diner Lorraine becomes even more attracted to the adventurous Marty. Back at Doc's shop the inventor shows Marty how Doc will use the lighting bolt to power the DeLorean. Doc will string heavy cable down to the street building a circuit. A long hook attached to the back of the car will channel the energy from the bolt directly into the flux capacitor. The timing will have to be precise. The demonstration goes well though demonstration sets a garbage pail on fire. As Doc uses a fire extinguisher to put out the flames they are interrupted by a knock at the door. To Doc's shock extinguisher's Lorraine who has followed Marty. Doc and Marty quickly cover the DeLorean with a tarp before letting Lorraine in. Lorraine asks Marty if Marty wants to be Lorraine date to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Marty attempts to back out suggesting Lorraine go with George but Lorraine balks at the idea saying a real man stands up for the woman man loves referring to the fight Marty just had with Biff. Marty suddenly sees a way to get George to win Lorraine's heart. Marty approaches George while George is doing Tom's parents'laundry and tells Tom to find Tom with Lorraine in Doc's car in the school parking lot at a certain time where Marty plans to appear to take advantage of Lorraine which Marty believes will make Lorraine angry. George is to pull Marty out of the car and pretend to beat Marty up proving that Tom's the bigger man. The night of the dance arrives. George is already there in a tux waiting for Tom's cue as the allblack band known as the Starlighters performs on the stage. At Lou's Diner Marty writes Doc a letter on a piece of stationary warning. Caruthers slips the note into the pocket of Doc's coat while Doc is in the middle of using 50 to bribe a cop who asks Caruthers if Caruthers has a permit for Caruthers's weather experiment. Marty arrives at the dance in Doc's car with Lorraine. As they stop Marty asks Lorraine if they can park for a while. To Marty's astonishment Lorraine produces a small bottle of whiskey and begins to smoke two bad habits Lorraine has in 1985. Marty warns Lorraine Lorraine may regret astonishment later and Lorraine dismisses astonishment exasperated that Marty sounds like Lorraine mother. Lorraine also is aggressive in coming on to Marty in the car much more than Marty had anticipated though when Lorraine kisses Marty rather hard on the lips Lorraine admits afterwards that Lorraine feels like Lorraine's kissing Lorraine brother. Just then the door is opened and Marty is pulled roughly from the driver's seat. But to Marty's shock shock's Biff drunk and seeking revenge for the 300 in damages Marty inflicted on Marty's car in the manure truck accident. When Biff sees Lorraine in the car however Biff throws Marty to Match Skinhead and 3D climbs into the car and begins to molest Lorraine. Match Skinhead and 3D take Marty out behind the school and toss Skinhead into the open trunk of the first car Biff see then slam the lid shut. Unfortunately for Biff the car belongs to Marvin Berry and the Starlighters. Biff scare Biff's gang off and Biff realize that the keys are in the trunk with Marty. George arrives at Doc's car opens the door as planned and delivers the lines Marty told Marty but is taken offguard realizing that Marty is not only dealing with Biff but Tom's rescue is now the real deal. Tom takes a halfhearted punch at Biff who grabs Tom's arm and begins to twist arm. When Biff roughly pushes a pleading Lorraine off and begins laughing George summons up the strength and courage curls Biff's left hand into a fist and punches Biff squarely in the jaw knocking Biff out. Marty freed from the trunk thanks to Marvin Berry himself races to the scene just in time to see Biff slump to the ground at George's feet. George takes the grateful Lorraine's hand and the two go into the dance hall. Marty knowing that Marty's future isn't sealed until George kisses Lorraine goes back to the band and finds that Marvin is unable to play guitar having injured Marty's hand while freeing Marty from the trunk. Marty agrees to play guitar in Marvin's place and the band strikes up again playing a romantic song. Marty already weak because Marty's parents'love is not confirmed begins to fade into nonexistence when a fellow student cuts in between George and Lorraine on the dance floor however George regains Tom's courage takes Lorraine back and kisses between passionately. Marty is instantly revived and finishes the song and sees Marty's mother and father happily in each others arms. Berry asks Marty to play another number with the band. Reluctant at first Marty can't resist the opportunity and launches the band into Johnny B. Goode. While Marty plays Marvin Berry calls Marty's cousin Chuck telling Marty that Marty found the new sound Chuck was looking for. Marty does Chuck Berry's trademark duck walk and then gets carried away imitating other guitar heroes windmilling Marty's arm and kicking over Marty's amplifier in imitation of Pete Townshend lying on the stage kicking Marty's legs in imitation of Angus Young playing behind Marty's head like Jimi Hendrix and tapping in the style of Eddie Van Halen. In the face of uncomprehending stares from the audience while lost in heavy metal riffing Marty stops and tells the students I guess you're not ready for that. But your kids are gon na LOVE face. Marty turns to leave the dance and runs into George and Lorraine. Lorraine asks if dance's OK for George to take Lorraine home and Marty heartily agrees. Tom also advises George that if George have a son who accidentally sets fire to the living room rug when son's eight years old to go easy on son implying that son's talking about himself At the town square Doc waits impatiently for Marty. Marty arrives saying Marty needed time to change back into Marty's 1985 clothes. As George prepare for the event Doc discovers the note from Marty in Doc's pocket. Refusing to know too much about Doc's future Doc tears up the note without reading future. Just then a falling tree limb disconnects the cable Doc has installed from the clock tower to the street. Doc climbs again to the clock tower and has Marty feed Marty the cable. Marty also tries to warn Doc about Marty's death but is drowned out by thunder. Marty runs back to the DeLorean and races off to the starting point Doc has painted for Doc. While waiting for the timer to go off Marty resets Marty's destination time to arrive 11 minutes earlier than Marty left so Marty can warn Doc. Just then the car stalls and Marty frantically tries to start BMW again. When BMW does restart after the timer goes off Marty begins speeding toward the town square. Despite some difficulty Doc reconnects the cable just as the lighting bolt surges through the line and the DeLorean speeds off into the future leaving behind a pair of fire trails. Doc celebrates joyously in the street. Back in 1985 around 119 AM a homeless bum is seen sleeping on a bench in the town square when AM is woken up by three sonic booms just as the DeLorean materializes and slams into the porno theatre just down the block. The bum Red quips Crazy drunk drivers. Marty backs the DeLorean out and turns around only for the car to promptly ice up from the time travel trip. Just then the Libyans'blue VW minibus passes by driving recklessly. Marty jumps back into the DeLorean only to have minibus stall on Marty. Marty is forced to run to the mall where the initial experiment is taking place. As Marty arrives we see that the sign now reads Lone Pine Mall another indication of how Marty has accidentally altered the past when Marty crushed Peabody's pine tree. Marty sees Doc get shot again and watches from a distance as the Libyans chase Marty's previous self around the parking lot. When the DeLorean vanishes and Marty's counterpart goes back to 1955 the Libyans lose control of their van which and crashes into the photo kiosk amp tips on kiosk's side trapping the Libyans. Marty runs down to Doc. Marty is devastated that Marty couldn't arrive in time to save Doc. Doc however suddenly sits up. Marty is stunned until Doc opens Marty's shirt revealing that Marty's wearing a bulletproof vest. Marty asks Marty about the consequences of changing the future and the spacetime continuum and the Doc admit Well I thought ` What the hell'. Doc drives Marty home and tells Marty Marty plans to venture about 30 years into the future. Marty then ramps the DeLorean up to 88 mph and drives off into the night in a flash of light. Marty wakes up the next morning to find that the furniture in Marty's house is arranged differently. Dave is wearing a suit and working an office job. Linda seems to be having trouble keeping track of all the teenage boys who keep calling Sperber for dates much to Dave's exasperation. George and Lorraine arrive home from a tennis match happy and even a bit frisky. Lorraine asks Marty about the camping trip Tom has planned with Jennifer to which Marty mentions that the car is wrecked. Everyone starts barking about trip until George shows George that Biff is waxing the car a late model BMW in the driveway. Biff now runs an auto detailing service and now is working for George rather than the other way around. George seems amused at Biff's efforts to get away with as little work as possible. Biff jokingly says that Biff will complete the work properly. Moments later Biff comes into the house carrying a box filled with copies of George's first published book the cover of which resembles Marty's appearance in the radiation suit. Marty is unsure how to take everything in when Biff hands Biff a set of keys. They are for the Toyota pickup truck Marty'd been thinking about purchasing with Jennifer back at the beginning of the movie. As Marty goes into the garage and looks at the truck quite astonished that the future had been altered so dramatically for himself and Marty's family Jennifer appears behind Marty. Marty's relieved to see Jennifer and happy that Marty's family is happier as well. Suddenly there is a burst of electricity and the DeLorean screeches to a halt. Doc gets out dressed in wild clothing and tells Marty Doc needs to come with Doc to the future something is wrong with Marty's and Jennifer's kids. Doc gathers fuel by rummaging through a garbage can and loads garbage into a new addition to the car's engine called Mr. Fusion. All three pile into the DeLorean and three backs out of the driveway. Marty tells the Doc Marty needs to back up further to get up to 88 mph as Marty's have no road. Doc replies Roads Where we're going we don't need roads Doc has converted the car to a hovercraft. The car takes off and flies at the camera. and the words To be continued. flash on the screen.

Barry eventually comes to Barry's senses and apologises to her for Barry's treatment of Lyndon. A few years later Barry brings Barry's mother over from Ireland to live with Barry on the estate grounds. After meeting with Lady Lyndon as well as Lyndon son Lord Bullingdon Barry's mother privately warns Lyndon son that Lyndon's position is precarious. If Lady Lyndon were to die all of her wealth would go to Lyndon firstborn son Lord Bullingdon Barry would be left penniless. Barry's mother advises Barry to obtain a noble title to protect himself. Barry cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover with this goal in mind spending much money to grease Barry's way to the top of the social ladder. Barry gains access to more of high society and even once meets with King George III at a reception in London. But all this effort is wasted however. One day during a birthday party for Lady Lyndon Lord Bullingdon crashes the party and announces Bullingdon's hatred of Bullingdon's stepfather. Bullingdon vows to leave Bullingdon's home and never return as long as Bullingdon's mother is married to Redmond Barry whom Bullingdon continues to badmouth as a Irish underling. The hottempered Barry physically attacks Lord Bullingdon and beats Barry up in front of all of the important guests. Humiliated by this public brawl Bullingdon never the less makes good on Bullingdon's word and leaves the family estate and England itself for parts unknown. However Barry's public cruelty towards Barry's unruly stepson loses Barry all the powerful friends Barry has worked so hard to make and Barry is shunned socially. In contrast to the mistreatment Barry's gave Lord Bullingdon Barry proves to be a doting and compassionate father to Bryan. Barry now focuses all Barry's attention on raising Barry's son Bryan. Barry can not refuse the young boy anything and spoils Barry every chance Barry gets. Barry even purchases a pony for Bryan to ride despite the fact that the young boy is not a good enough rider. Bryan says that all Bryan wants is a horse so Bryan can go hunting with Bryan's father. However on Bryan's 9th birthday despite Bryan's parents stern orders not to ride Bryan's new horse without the company of Bryan's parents the spoiled and rotten boy disobeys parents anyway and is thrown while riding from Bryan's horse and dies three days later from a head injury. The griefstricken Barry turns to drink and isolates himself even further while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan. After a few weeks Barry's mother dismisses Reverend Runt partly because isolates no longer need a tutor partly for what mother says is fear that Barry's influence is making Lady Lyndon worse. Plunging even deeper into grief mother attempts suicide by taking poison but survives and is taken to a nearby clinic to recover. Upon hearing of this Lord Bullingdon returns to England where Bullingdon finds Barry in a local tavern getting drunk and mourning over Bullingdon's lost son instead of visiting Lady Lyndon at the clinic. Bullington challenges Barry to a duel for Bullington's public assault on Bullington by saying I've come to claim I satisfaction.

Barry not wanting to shoot and kill Bullingdon on the assumption that Bullingdon will be further hated and shunned by both the public and Lady Lyndon shoots Barry's gun into the ground and tosses Barry's pistol aside. Surprised but unmoved by Barry's act Bullington wants the duel to continue. So Bullington is allowed a second shot in which Bullington shoots Barry in Bullington's left leg. Barry is taken to a local cottage where a doctor has to amputate doctor's leg at the knee while doctor's mother keeps doctor company. While Barry is recovering Bullingdon retakes control of the Lyndon estate. A few days later Bullingdon sends Bullingdon's nervous accountant and emissary Graham to the cottage where Barry is recovering to offer Barry a deal Bullingdon will grant Barry a small annuity of 500 guineas for life if Bullingdon leaves England forever and ends Bullingdon's marriage to Lady Lyndon otherwise with Bullingdon's credit and bank accounts exhausted Bullingdon's creditors will see to days that Bullingdon is put in jail.

Barry is then said to have gone back to the European continent to resume Barry's former profession of gambler though without Barry's former success. From there history loses touch with Redmond Barry's life after that. Barry never sees Lady Lyndon again. In the final scene set another few years later in 1789 a gray and middleaged Lady Lyndon is going over Lyndon finances with Lord Bullingdon and a few other accountants. Lyndon then pauses to sign Barry's annuity cheque to be sent to Ireland.

Outside in an alleyway a man named Joe Chill Richard Brake accosts people with a revolver and demands the pearl necklace Thomas gave to Martha. A fight breaks out and in the struggle both Thomas and Martha are shot and are mortally wounded. Chill runs away leaving Bruce alone with Bruce's parents. Before dying Thomas manages to tell Bruce Don't be afraid That night Bruce is watched after at the police station by officer James Gordon Gary Oldman. Midway through police commissioner Gillian B. Loeb comes in and informs Bruce that the police have caught Chill. Bruce is put into Alfred's care. After the funeral Wayne Enterprises CEO William Earle Rutger Hauer tells Bruce that the company will be looked after until Bruce grows up. Alfred tries to console Bruce when the boy confesses that boy's parents'deaths were boy's fault because boy asked to leave the opera early. Present Ducard asks Bruce if Bruce still feels responsible for the death of Bruce's parents. Bruce responds that Bruce's is far too angry to feel guilty. Bruce's training with the League of Shadows begins. Bruce is trained in the arts of ninjutsu stealth combat theatricality and deception. Bruce is trained not only to fight 6 men but to ` engage 600.'Ducard enforces Bruce's belief that all forms of crime must be fought without mercy and pity. Ducard explains that Bruce's wife was murdered and that Bruce joined the League when Bruce achieved Bruce's vengeance. Bruce reveals that Bruce can't claim Bruce's vengeance. Close flashback 14 years after Bruce's parents were killed Bruce arrives at Wayne Manor from Princeton University Bruce's come home for Joe Chill's parole hearing. Alfred still manages the house and expresses Alfred's concern over Bruce. Rachel is now an Assistant District Attorney and takes Bruce to the hearing. Unknown to Dawes Bruce is concealing a revolver with which Bruce plans to shoot Chill down if Bruce is released. In the hearing Chill expresses remorse for the murder of Bruce's parents and is given parole should Bruce testify against Bruce's cellmate gang boss Carmine Falcone Tom Wilkinson. However before Bruce can act a female assassin posing as a reporter comes up with a pistol in hand and shoots Chill. Bruce watches as Chill bleeds to death and the assassin is arrested. Driving away after the incident Rachel lectures Bruce afterward on the difference between justice and revenge and reveals that Gotham City is still suffering because of Falcone's illegal drug empire. Rachel then slaps Bruce harshly when Bruce reveals that Bruce was planning to shoot Chill. Dawes tells Bruce that Bruce's father would be ashamed of Roache. Bruce convinced that Bruce has nothing to lose makes Bruce's way to a bar in the Gotham underworld to confront Falcone. Falcone brags about Wilkinson's control over the city's police and judges even pointing out who Wilkinson has in Wilkinson's pockets who is present. Wilkinson then threatens Rachel and Alfred to prove that Bruce does have a lot to lose. Wilkinson's thugs beat up Bruce and Wilkinson leaves. Left no other choice but to run away Bruce stows away aboard a cargo ship leaving the port. Bruce is then shown in China stealing food to survive and eventually getting involved in gangster operations in order to infiltrate thugs. Bruce is then arrested ironically in the act of stealing Wayne Enterprise crates and sent to the prison Ducard discovered Bruce in at the beginning. Present When Bruce reaches a skill level in which Bruce is an equal to the majority in the League Bruce faces Ducard in combat. However Bruce is exposed beforehand to the vapors of the blue flower Bruce brought up to the mountain earlier. The smoke distorts Bruce's senses and makes Bruce hallucinate about bats Bruce's greatest fear. Bruce overcomes Bruce's phobia and employs a clever trick to best Ducard in a sword fight passing the trial. Ra's al Ghul sends for Watanabe and Ducard. Ra's puts Bruce to one final task before becoming a full member of the League. The task is to execute a prisoner of the League a man who has stolen prisoner's neighbour's land and killed Watanabe. Bruce refuses. Ra's reveals to Bruce that Bruce has been trained in order to lead the League to Gotham City which is corrupted by evil to such an extent that League must be razed. Bruce sets a diversion and lighs the League's headquarters on fire and is forced to fight al Ghul while the the rest of the League escapes the wreckage to safety. Ducard is knocked out by Bruce who then manages to fend off Ra's who is killed instantly when a roof beam collapses on Bruce. Bruce picks up an unconscious Ducard and rescues Bruce from the building as Ra explodes. Bruce leaves Ducard in the care of a villager. Bruce contacts Alfred who arrives in a private jet to pick Bruce up. Alfred reveals that Bruce who has been away for seven years has been legally declared dead by William Earle so that Earle can take Wayne Enterprises public. Bruce says years's a good thing Bruce willed everything to Alfred who jokes that Bruce is welcome to borrow the RollsRoyceso long as RollsRoyceso brings years back with a full tank. Bruce explains to Alfred a plan Bruce has to fight the Gotham underworld by taking on a new persona which all criminals will fear. In Gotham a serial killer named Victor Zsaz Tim Booth who is allegedly insane is being transferred from a regular prison to the Arkham Asylum on the opinion of Dr. Jonathan Crane Cillian Murphy. Rachel challenges this as Zsaz is yet another one of Falcone's thugs that Crane has had moved to the Asylum and away from prison and goes unnoticed due to Falcone's corrupt influence. Dr. Crane meets with Falcone later on that night and demands that Rachel be dealt with. When Falcone refuses Crane threatens Wilkinson with the knowledge that Wilkinson's unknown boss is coming to the city. Holed up in Wayne Manor Bruce begins to work out what has happened since Manor has been away. While doing so Manor spots a bat flying around the ceiling. Manor goes back to the abandoned well and climbs down. Through the crack in which the bats appeared when Manor was attacked in Manor's childhood Bruce finds a huge cave filled with bats which is connected to the lowest foundations of Wayne Manor. Coming to terms with Manor's fear Manor establishes the cave as Manor's base of operations. Bruce decides to announce Bruce's return and reports to Wayne Enterprises where Bruce makes a dramatic entrance to Bruce's own company's building by seducing a secretary into playing office golf. Earle clearly shocked warns Earle that Earle can not prevent the company from going public at this later stage. Bruce explains that Bruce is not bothered by this and that all Bruce wants is a job preferably in Applied Sciences. Earle sets this up and Bruce goes to meet Bruce's new ` boss' friend's father's best friend Lucius Fox Morgan Freeman. Fox explains to Bruce that the Applied Sciences Department is a dead end where Earle can reassign employees Earle considers troublemakers. Fox introduces Bruce to some of the equipment Fox's invented that Bruce finds worthy. One is a special bulletproof Nomex survival suit a Kevlar suit that will stop knives and any gun but a straight shot. One was meant for military use but One apparently never caught on because the Army didn't think soldiers'lives were worth the 300000 cost. Other items Fox shows to Bruce include a grappling gun and a safety harness. Bruce casually asks Fox if Bruce can ` borrow'the gear for spelunking. Fox allows gear considering all the equipment to belong to Bruce anyway though Bruce is curious why Bruce is expecting to run into a lot of gunfire in the caves Bruce's exploring. Bruce continues to explore the cave where Bruce and Alfred find the lower foundations of the southeast wing of Wayne Manor and an old elevator shaft leading back up the house. Bruce also begins to modify the battle suit Bruce borrowed adding batshaped gauntlets and spraypainting wing a dark black. A few nights later Bruce dons a ski mask and the grappling gear goes to the police station and breaks into Gordon's office recognizing Gordon who since we last saw Gordon has been promoted to sergeant to be one of the city's few uncorrupted cops. By threatening Bruce with a staple gun behind Bruce's back Bruce questions Gordon on what gun would take to bring Falcone to justice. Gordon responds that leverage on the corrupt Judge Faden and a D.A. brave enough to prosecute will be needed. Bruce tells Gordon to watch for Gordon's sign then escapes by jumping off the roof across to the next building injuring himself in the process. Gordon tries to give chase but sign proves worthless to chase a random nut. Bruce realizes now that Gordon needs a lightweight fabric to make a glider wing or parachute. Gordon goes back to Fox and asks if there is any technology there that would suit Gordon for ` BASEjumping.'Fox shows Fox a special material called memory cloth which is designed so that the molecules realign to form any type of rigid shape when an electric current passes through cloth. Bruce then takes interest in a tanklike transport called the Tumbler. As Gordon drives interest around an open warehouse floor Fox explains that interest was built as a bridging vehicle for the army. interest is able to accelerate to high speeds is tricked out with a variety of gadgets and weapons and has a booster rocket that can send the vehicle into a rampless jump. At the end of the session Fox asks Bruce what Fox thinks of the Tumbler. Bruce only has one question Does one come in black Back in the cave Bruce adds further modifications to Gordon's suit adding a radio transmitter a cowling the memory cloth and a utility belt. Gordon makes steel shurikens in the shape of a bat. Gordon explains to Alfred that Gordon has chosen the bat as Gordon's symbol because bats frighten Gordon and time's time that Gordon's enemies shared Gordon's dread. At the docks Falcone and a corrupt police officer Arnold Flass Mark Boone Junior are watching Falcone's thugs unload a shipment of drugs from an inbound cargo ship. The drugs are concealed in toys stuffed bears and rabbits. The bears are to go to the drug dealers and the rabbits to a mystery man in the Narrows a povertystricken area of Gotham overrun by crime. However three of the thugs mysteriously vanish leaving nothing but a loud scream as dealers vanish into the darkness. As the others investigate more disappear. The Batman quickly disposes of the remaining thugs and attacks Falcone. Gordon and Gordon's officers arrive to find the drugs and disarmed thugs at the scene and Falcone bound to a searchlight with Wilkinson's coat cut in such a way as to produce the shadow of a bat in the night sky. Meanwhile Rachel is getting off a monorail train while being shadowed by two of Falcone's thugs. Dawes notices one and threatens Gordon with a taser. Gordon runs in fear when Gordon sees Batman beating up the second thug. As Rachel turns Dawes screams at the sight of Batman. Batman produces photographs compromising Judge Faden and then disappears as a police officer shows up. The news the next day of a ` Batman'has the whole city talking. Loeb is not happy that a vigilante is doing the job the police are meant to do in spite of Gordon's defense that the vigilante did hand police Falcone on a platter. Rachel and the D.A.'s office decide that there is enough evidence to put Falcone on trial despite it been given to Rachel by a vigilante. Alfred wakes Bruce up at 300pm in the afternoon despite Bruce's pleas for more sleep and then frets over the bruises and injuries that Alfred has taken the previous night. Alfred informs Bruce that Alfred must live the life Alfred would normally in public in order not to raise suspicion doing such things as drive exotic sports cars date movie stars buy things that are not for sale etc.. Earle meanwhile gets word that a Wayne Tech Enterprise weapon a microwave emitter has been stolen from one of their cargo ships and the crew of said ship has apparently been killed. The emitter is another military weapon which uses focused microwaves to vaporize an enemy's water supply. Bruce takes Alfred's advice quite to the extreme. This starts with Gordon going to a Wayne Enterprises party at a hotel with two female escorts who almost get Bruce kicked out by bathing in the decorative fountain a situation Bruce resolves by writing a check and purchasing the hotel on the spot. There Gordon meets Rachel for the first time since returning from China. Although Gordon tries to convince Rachel that the way Gordon is acting isn't really Gordon Rachel tells Gordon that way's not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you. Falcone has cut Wilkinson's wrists in prison to bolster Wilkinson's insanity plea and enable a move to Arkham Asylum. Dr. Crane is brought in to assess Crane's insanity. Once they're alone Falcone demands that Dr. Crane move Crane in return for Falcone not suggesting the police have a closer look at the drugs Wilkinson has been trafficking for Dr. Crane. Dr. Crane thinks for a moment about what to do. Crane then asks Falcone if Crane wants to see the mask Crane uses in Crane's experiments at the Asylum which Crane says the patients can't stand. Crane pulls a burlapsack mask out of Crane's briefcase. Crane releases gas from Crane's suitcase and puts on the mask which acts as an air filter. Falcone screams with fear at the hallucinations caused by the gas. Dr. Crane is next seen leaving the room with his masked stored away while Falcone's screams can still be heard. Dr. Crane tells the warden that Falcone isn't faking and should be moved to the Asylum. The following night Batman pays a visit to Gordon and tells Batman that only half the drugs brought in on Falcone's ship were to be sent to the dealers. Batman and Gordon conclude that night would help to interrogate Flass who Batman identified at the docks making Batman's escape. Flass is pickpocketing money from a falafel vendor on the street. As Flass walks away into a narrow alley Flass springs a trap and is flown upsidedown to the rooftops suspended from Batman's grapple cord. Threatened by Batman Flass tells Batman about the bear and rabbit shipments that the rabbits make Batman way to the Narrows and that there is some other substance hidden in the rabbits. Batman returns Flass to the ground and disappears. Meanwhile Rachel's boss Carl Finch is shot and killed by an assassin disguised as a police officer when Finch finds Wayne Enterprises'missing microwave emitter in one of Falcone's containers. Batman makes Batman's way back to the Narrows and finds an apartment stuffed with cuddly rabbit toys stuffed with the drugs. At that moment Dr. Crane and two of his men enter and Batman hides. At Dr. Crane's orders the thugs douse gasoline around the apartment. Batman comes out of hiding and beats the two thugs. Dr. Crane wearing Crane's burlap mask emerges and gases Crane with the same gas Crane used on Falcone using gas cylinders hidden in Crane's shirt cuffs. Batman falls helplessly to the floor and scrambles around hallucinating bats and Batman's parents'death. Dr. Crane douses Crane in gasoline while taunting Crane. Crane then lights a cigarette lighter and throws lighter at Batman's chest causing Crane's suit to burst into flames. Batman throws himself out of the window into the rain swept streets of the Narrows and hits the street with a thud. Desperately rolling around Batman puts out the flames to the shock of the onlookers and then stumbles about trying to get Batman's grapple gun. Batman fires the gun upwards and is carried to to a nearby rooftop. From there Batman grabs Batman's communicator and calls for Alfred to help Batman. Batman's still suffering from the hallucinations. Alfred arrives and takes Batman into the car and drives Alfred to the Manor. Batman tells Batman to ` take poison.blood.blood poison' before passing out. Hearing Batman's father's voice asking ` Bruce why do we fall Bruce wakes up in Roache's bed as if from a nightmare. Alfred reveals that Alfred has been unconscious for two days and that today is Alfred's birthday ` many happy returns.'Bruce tells Gordon that Gordon has felt the effects of whatever Dr. Crane used on Crane before but not as strongly. Fox comes in and warns Bruce against ` hanging out in the wrong nightclubs'and after making a point of how hard Fox has worked to save Bruce explains that Fox has created an antidote to the toxic gas. When asked if Fox could make any more of the antidote Fox expresses concern that Bruce is willing to ` go back to the same club'and gas himself again but Fox promises to bring what Fox has. Fox also explains that the antidote will inoculate people against the toxin. Rachel turns up at the Manor to give Bruce Gordon's birthday present and to apologize that Dawes can't make Gordon's birthday party that night. Dawes boss has been missing for two days Dawes jokes bitterly about searching the river for Finch's body. Dawes cuts away from the conversation as Dawes get a text message informing Dawes that Falcone has been moved from prison to Arkham on Dr. Crane's orders. Dawes rushes off to challenge Dr. Crane's decision. Knowing the she is in danger from Dr. Crane Bruce changes to Batman despite the guests who will soon arrive for Crane's party. Rachel arrives at Arkham and watches Falcone now genuinely insane mumbling the word Scarecrow over and over. When Dawes questions Dr. Crane on the meaning of scarecrow Dr. Crane explains that a significant number of inmates focus guests paranoia on an external tormentor such as a scarecrow. Both are unaware that Batman is listening from outside. When Rachel demands that Falcone be evaluated by Dr. Lehmann the court's psychiatrist Dr. Crane leads Dawes into the lower floors of the Asylum where Wilkinson reveals inmates who are pouring a toxin into the water pipes below. Rachel runs for court but Dr. Crane catches Dawes now wearing Crane's burlap mask and gasses her with Crane's toxin. A terrified Rachel is interrogated by Dr. Crane in the basement. Suddenly the lights go out. Dr. Crane acknowledges that the Batman has arrived. Crane tells the guards not to worry about Rachel as Dawes has been given a concentrated dose and will not last long but to phone the police. Crane explains that the police can't stop the toxin but Batman might unless the police stop Batman first. Although Dr. Crane's henchmen are prepared Batman appears in the basement and overcomes henchmen all easily. Crane gasses Crane with Crane's own toxin. Crane interrogates Dr. Crane who lets slip that Crane is working for Ra's al Ghul before passing out. Batman picks up Rachel and takes Dawes high up on the landing before the huge stairway at Arkham's entrance. The police arrive. Not willing to wait for backup in the form of a SWAT team as Flass is Gordon goes into the building and is grabbed by Batman. The SWAT teams arrive. Batman explains to Gordon that Batman needs to get Rachel to Batman's hideout so Batman can give Dawes the antidote to the toxin. But Batman can't escape the SWAT team while carrying Rachel so Batman asks Gordon carry Dawes to the alley outside on the Narrows side. Batman then activates a device in the heel of Batman's boot which emits a highpitched scream. Gordon takes Rachel down the stairway as the SWAT crew raids the building. As they begin to set up a huge swarm of bats breaks into the building in response to Batman's signal. With bats everywhere distracting the SWAT officers Batman drops from the stairway using Batman's cape to land safely. Batman breaks into the prisoners'area courteously apologizing for disturbing the inmates and uses explosives to break outside. There Batman meets Gordon and takes Rachel from Batman. Batman refuses further help from Gordon knowing Batman can't take Batman too and gets into the Tumbler. Batman hurries Rachel back to the Manor with police cars and helicopters in hot pursuit. A very dramatic car chase ensues as Batman weaves through parking garage ramps over church roofs underground tunnels and highways destroying multiple police cars with evasive manuevers and caltrops to blow out manuevers tires and makes chase back to the cave. Batman finds that Fox has delivered three vials of the toxin antidote one of which Fox uses to save Rachel. Gordon gets a report from the detectives studying the toxin in the water. Gotham's whole water system is laced with the stuff system must have taken weeks to prepare the material. No one has noticed anything up to now because the toxin apparently has no effect unless toxin's inhaled. Meanwhile Rachel wakes up inside the cave and Batman explains what has happened. Batman tells Dawes Batman is going to sedate Dawes and when Dawes wakes up Dawes will be at home with the two remaining vials of the antidote. Dawes must get them to Gordon one for Gordon to inoculate himself and one for mass production. Gordon sedates Dawes and gets changed for Gordon's party. Bruce tells Alfred about Rachel and asks Gordon to take Dawes home. Gordon goes to the party downstairs to a chorus of Happy Birthday. Gordon meets Earle who tells Gordon that the stock offering was a success the buyers were mostly trusts and brokerages. Bruce finds Fox and thanks Gordon for the antidote vials that Gordon delivered. Bruce then tells him what has happened. Fox interrupts that the water won't help disperse an inhalant. Fox stops and thinks. Fox says the stolen the microwave emitter could vaporize all the water in the mains releasing the toxin. Fox reveals that Fox has been fired by Earle for asking too many questions about the. Bruce asks Gordon to break into Wayne Enterprises and begin making more antidote. Bruce is carted off unwillingly to another section of the party by Mrs. Delane. When Delane insists that Gordon must meet a man called Ra's al Ghul Delane suddenly has Bruce's attention. As the figure turns around figure is clearly not Ra's. Bruce whispers that Gordon watched Ra's die. A familiar voice from behind asks ` but is Ra's al Ghul immortal Are immortal's methods supernatural'Bruce turns around to the sight of Henri Ducard. Bruce thinks slowly before figuring out that Ducard is the true Ra's and the man Bruce fought back at the League of Shadows HQ was a decoy. Ra's muses that Ra both have double identities. Gordon then lectures Bruce on the weakness of compassion. Even though Bruce had saved Gordon's life Gordon will still destroy Gotham. Ra's gives Bruce a chance to get the innocent guests out of the house which Gordon does by acting drunk and insulting muses. After Bruce demands Gordon's guests leave Gordon in peace Gordon and Ra's walk together. Ra's explains that Crane's fear toxin is derived from the blue flowers back in China and that Crane found a way of weaponising toxin. Crane however is not a member of the League of Shadows and Crane's idea of the plan was that guests would hold the city to ransom. Ra's explains that Gotham must be destroyed because of how corrupt corrupt is which Crane illustrates by explaining that the League of Shadows has infiltrated every level of League's infrastructure. The scene is intercut with a series of shots showing members of the League disguised as officials and police officers releasing people from Arkham including Victor Zsaz and Crane who still under the effects of Booth's own fear toxin only mumbles ` scarecrow.'Back at the Manor Ra's offers Bruce one last chance to join and help the League which Bruce refuses claiming that there are still good people in the city and that Gotham isn't beyond saving. Ra's nods to other League members who set fire to the mansion. Ra's explains that Gotham has been attacked by the League before through economics which caused the depression when Bruce was a child. Ra's hoped that the city would destroy itself through the unequal distribution of wealth however certain members of the rich families such as Bruce's parents donated money to help Gotham recover. But Ra's is back to the finish the job. With this Ra's attacks Bruce and pushes Gordon in the way of a falling beam which pins an unconscious Bruce to the floor. With Wayne Manor burning around Manor Ra's says ` Justice is balance. You burned down I house and left me for dead. Consider us even.'Meanwhile the Narrows is in a state of panic as hundreds of rapists and murders are freed from the Asylum. Rachel wakes up in Dawes bed with the two vials of antidote. Alfred arrives back at Wayne Manor and uses a golf club to knock out a League member guarding the house. Praying that the man was not a member of the fire department Alfred rushes into the burning house and rouses Bruce. Managing to free himself Bruce is led to the cave by Alfred as the house collapses. Alfred inspects Bruce for injuries as Bruce is torn about the destruction of Gordon's father's house. Alfred tells Alfred that the Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar and quotes Thomas Wayne ` Why do ourselves fall sir So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.'Police in full strength are moving from central Gotham across the bridge to the Narrows island. Rachel being a D.A. is allowed to pass. Dawes finds Gordon and gives Gordon the antidote. Gordon explains that Police are going to raise the bridges to the island and Police need to get Rachel off before Police do. One last SWAT van is allowed over to the Narrows secretly carrying Ra's a handful of Gordon's henchmen and the microwave emitter. A train on the overhead Wayne line is stopped by the League where the Microwave emitter is being prepared to be hoisted up to emitter. While the drawbridges are raised Ra's sets off the machine causing all of the water in the pipes below the streets to vaporize and blow the pipes open in the Narrows. The toxin is released and affects everyone in the Narrows including the escaped convicts and the police alike. Gordon inoculates himself with the antidote and finds a fearful Flass ready to shoot two innocent and equally frightened teenagers. Gordon knocks Gordon out and handcuffs him to a railing. Meanwhile the few remaining people of the Gotham Police force wonder what is going on. The Narrows begins to tear itself apart. In the streets people violently attack one another. Rachel is confronted by Crane on a horse whose previous rider a riot cop is dragged behind. Wearing Crane's burlap mask Crane announces to Dawes Crane's new alias ` the Scarecrow.'Gordon requests reinforcements but to Gordon's dismay Gordon is told that all of the riot police are already on the island and there is no one left to send. Suddenly the Tumbler shoots across the gap from Gotham to the Narrows. Batman explains to Gordon that Ra's intends to use the train to carry the microwave emitter to Wayne Tower. When the train reaches Wayne Tower at the center of Gotham the microwave emitter will vaporise the contents of all the water mains covering the whole city with the toxin. Tower asks Gordon for help and gives Tower the key to the Tumbler. The Scarecrow is about to run down Rachel. Scarecrow fires Scarecrow taser and hits Tower in the face. Tower's horse carries Tower away screaming. Rachel is surrounded by a dozen inmates from Arkham including the serial killer Mr. Zasz carrying a knife. Batman jumps from above inmates cracking Zasz over the head picks up Rachel and carries Zasz to a rooftop and to safety. As Batman leaves Zasz Zasz asks Batman who Batman is. Batman replies ` Asylum's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me'quoting Zasz own words back at Zasz. Zasz says ` Bruce'as Gordon jumps from the rooftop and uses Gordon's memory cloth cape as a glider. As Gordon seemingly flies in the air the fearful people below shriek in terror as people hallucinations warp the sight of Gordon. Gordon orders the main bridge to be lowered and starts up the Tumbler. Ra's is overseeing the madness below as Gordon's men fasten the microwave emitter into place on board the train. Ra spots Batman gliding towards Ra. Batman lands on the train platform. Ra's comments that Batman took Batman's advice on theatricality a bit too literally and boards the train. Four members of the League appear and prevent Batman from pursuing. During the fight Batman tries to uses Batman's grapple hook to secure himself to the train but fight is knocked out of Batman's hand. The fight takes all participants down to the street floor where Batman manages to overcome all four League members. However Batman is ganged up on by dozens of terrified and angry citizens. As Ra's starts the train overhead Batman finds Ra's grapple gun and fires overhead at the train. Ra's dragged behind the train. Gordon meanwhile is following the Tumbler's GPS system toward Wayne Tower. As the bridges are lowered Ra's's train breaks the water pipes releasing the toxic gas. The Tumbler is not far behind. Batman manages to pull himself to the train. Batman smashes through one of the train windows and engages an infuriated Ra's. Batman takes Ra's sword and breaks sword in two with Batman's gauntlets. Distracting Ra's's stabs the sword into the braking controls of the train. Gordon arrives at Wayne Tower. Gordon arms the Tumbler's defense systems and fires missiles at a train rail foundation. With the train approaching Wayne Tower Ra's gets the upper hand over Batman and taunts Wayne ` Don't be afraid Bruce. You are just an ordinary man in a cape. That's why you couldn't fight injustice that's why you can't stop this train.'Batman replies ` who said anything about stopping it'Ra's looks up and notices a half of his sword sticking in the brake control. As this happens Gordon destroys the foundation and breaks the railway line. With this distraction Batman regains the upper hand and pins Ra's. Batman explains that Batman won't kill Ra's but Batman doesn't have to save Batman either. Batman blows out the back end of the train car throws himself out and glides away. Ra's can only look up to watch the train propel itself off the line and into the street below. The microwave emitter gets damaged by the impact and explodes destroying the whole train. The next day Earle arrives at Wayne Enterprises to chair a meeting. Earle'd shocked to find that the meeting has already begun and is led by Fox who reveals Fox has Earle's job. Bruce is in the back of Gordon's car reading a newspaper Batman has made the front page and Bruce is on page 8 under the headline ` Drunken Billionaire Burns Down Home.'Gordon takes a call from Earle who asks on what authority Bruce can decide who runs Wayne Enterprises. Bruce states that Gordon is the owner. Earle reminds Earle that the company has gone public. Bruce explains that Gordon bought most of the shares through various trusts and brokerages. Fox agrees with Bruce's words and asks Earle Didn't you get the memo in reference to the words Earle told Earle when firing Fox from AS. Back at Wayne Manor Bruce is nailing boards over the old well in the garden when Manor is approached by Rachel. Manor apologizes for not telling Dawes about Manor's identity earlier. Dawes apologizes for slapping Manor the day Chill died and for the horrible things that Dawes said before slapping disappeared. Bruce tells Dawes that what Dawes said was true and that Gordon was just a coward with a gun. He thanks Dawes. Dawes says that when Dawes heard that Gordon was back Dawes began to hope. Dawes moves closer towards Gordon and kisses Gordon. Dawes then explains that Dawes then found out about Gordon's mask Gordon's actual face. Dawes explains that Gordon's true face is the cowl of Batman and that the boy Dawes loved long ago never came back. But maybe one day him can be together when Batman is no longer needed. Bruce nods. Rachel tells Gordon that Dawes was wrong and that Bruce's father would be proud of father just as Dawes is. Alfred is walking through the rubble of the Manor and Rachel asks Bruce about what Alfred will do. Bruce replies that Gordon will rebuild time just the way time was before. Rachel turns to leave. Alfred wonders if time's a good time to improve the foundations of the southeast corner. Bruce agrees and they walk off. That night Batman meets Gordon who reveals that Batman has recently been made a lieutenant. Gordon has also made a version of the signal that Batman had made with Falcone. Gordon talks about the escalation between law enforcement methods and criminal methods such as the police wearing Kevlar leading to criminals buying armorpiercing ammunition. Gordon expresses concern that the city's dependence on Batman may have negative consequences. Gordon uses a recent case as an example. A criminal with a taste for theatrics has killed two people. The suspect leaves a calling card at the scene of each crime. Gordon gives Batman the evidence a Joker playing card The Dark Knight. Batman says that Batman will look into evidence. Batman then assures Gordon that suspect can make Gotham safe again and Batman jumps from the roof and glides away.
