This heartwarming true story is an American adaptation of a Japanese tale about a loyal dog named Hachiko. This very special friend would accompany friend's master to the train station every day and return each afternoon to greet friend after work. Sadly friend's master goes to work one day, but dies at work and never returns to the station. Hachiko faithfully returns to the same spot at the station that evening, and every day until the last day of Hachiko's life, to wait for Hachiko's beloved master. During Hachiko's daily visits, Hachiko touches the lives of many who work near and commute through the train station square. Hachiko teaches the local people love, compassion and above all, unyielding loyalty. Today, a bronze statue of Hachiko sits in Hachiko's waiting spot outside the Shibuya station in Japan as a permanent reminder of Hachiko's devotion and love.
