This is essentially a four act play. In the first act we meet the Ekdahl family large, joyous, prosperous. Then Oscar, father of Alexander who might be 11 and Fanny who might be 7, dies. In act two, Oscar appears to Oscar's children. Alexander asks why Alexander doesn't go off to Heaven. Oscar replies that Oscar doesn't want to leave those Oscar lived with. The children's mother remarries in less than a year, going to a strict Bishop Edvard Vergerus'house with none of mother furniture, none of the children's toys, and an optimism that mother can make a good thing of house despite Edvard's powerfully controlling personality. Alexander learns from the ghost of the Bishop's first wife that ghost and ghost children died trying to escape after having been locked up for days. ghost climbed out a window but failed to make window across the cold fastflowing stream that separates the back of the house from the town. Alexander tells this to a servant who repeats this to the Bishop. The Bishop must discredit this story, and demands retraction. Then Edvard locks up the boy. In act three, Isak, a family friend, arrives at the house, ostensibly to buy a chest, but actually to smuggle the children out of the house. During this escape, the ghosts of Isak's former family appear to the Bishop. The children are kept for the moment in Isak's house, where Alexander meets Ismael Retzinsky whose paranormal abilities help Alexander start a fire in the Bishop's house, a fire that is fatal to the hated stepfather. In the final act, mother and children are back in the warm comfort of children extended family's house. Gustav, the late Oscar's brother, gives a toast in which Gustav summarizes the play. Without mentioning ghosts explicitly, Gustav says there are things we know and should enjoy, such as food and dance, and many more aspects of life of which we are ignorant.
