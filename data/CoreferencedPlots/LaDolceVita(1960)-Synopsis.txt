Another way to look at La Dolce Vita is to think of Marcello's journey as the cinematic version of the Book of Daniel which describes the Apocalypse or Revelation a disclosure of something hidden from the majority of mankind in an era dominated by falsehood and misconception. The film begins with the imagery of Christ flying over Rome as a helicopter carries a religious statue aloft over the city or visions of Angels. Marcello's journey includes encounters with the Great Whore, the suicide of Marcello's close friend whose life has descended into despair, a Judgment of the wicked, the Beast, the purity of the virginal young girl who beckons to Marcello to save Marcello but Marcello chooses the decadent life viewed in this way, the film has a layer of symbolism that deepens journey.
