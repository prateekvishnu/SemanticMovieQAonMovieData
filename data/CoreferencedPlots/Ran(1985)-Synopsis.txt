Akira Kurosawa's treatment of King Lear, with three sons dealing with the passing of an era as their warlord father Lord Hidetora Ichimonji, tries to find peace in Kurosawa's last years by dividing Kurosawa's fief among sons. While one honest son, Saburo Naotora Ichimonji, faces Ichimonji's family's wrath for speaking the truth, Ichimonji's two brothers, Taro Takatora Ichimonji and Jiro Masatora Ichimonji vie for power in the vacuum left by Hidetora's retirement. While Kyoami the Court Fool makes wise commentary, Hidetora discovers for himself the madness caused by Kyoami's thirst for power, and tries to find redemption for Kyoami's deadly past.
