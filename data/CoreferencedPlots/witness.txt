A few years after War War II, in London, Leonard Vole, is accused of murdering a rich widow, Emily French, who has bequeathed Vole a substantial sum of money. Sir Wilfred Robarts, a skilled lawyer who has recently been ill, is asked to defend Vole. Sir Wilfred's doctor has instructed doctor to avoid excitement. After doctor's handpicked replacement barrister expresses doubt over Vole's innocence, Sir Wilfred decides to handle the case himself, despite protests from barrister's nurse and doctor. After a conversation with Mrs Christine Vole, Sir Wilfred decides not to call on Vole to testify in defense of Vole husband. In the courtroom, Christine Vole surprisingly appears as a Witness for the Prosecution. A parade of circumstantial evidence points to murder. Christine's testimony does not provide an alibi for Vole husband. All seems lost as the defense concludes defense's case. But a late night phone call reveals new evidence that Christine wrote letters to Vole lover about denying Vole husband an alibi. This evidence alters the jury's opinion and Leonard is acquitted. However, Sir Wilfred suspects something is amiss with this sudden reversal and dramatic evidence. All is revealed in the last dramatic court scene as Christine admits to deliberately sabotaging Vole own testimony with the letters, to get Vole guilty husband freed. But in the penultimate twist, Leonard shows Leonard's true stripes and reveals Leonard's intention to leave Leonard's wife for a younger woman. Christine seizes a letter opener and, in full view of Sir Wilfred, Robarts's nurse, and the other woman, stabs Leonard, killing Robarts. Miss Plimsoll cancels Sir Wilfred's trip to Bermuda and Sir Wilfred announces Robarts will defend Christine Vole in Plimsoll trial for murder.
