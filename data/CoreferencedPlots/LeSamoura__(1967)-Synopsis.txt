Alain Delon stars, as Jeff Costello is an assassin who lives a solitary life with no friends. Costello begins Costello's new assignment stealing a car, obtaining new license plates and a gun from Costello's associate. Costello then drives to a nightclub at night and shoots the owner, accidentally being seen by the club pianist Valerie. The police pick up Costello and with the investigation led by a determined Police Inspector, subject Police and many others to a line up. Costello is released because Costello has set up an alibi with Jan Lagrange, and also because Valerie lies and states that Valerie did not see Costello. When Costello goes to collect Costello's money for killing the club owner, Costello's employer attempts to kill Costello. Police Inspector puts together a team of undercover cops to trail Costello through the Paris Metro, an underground labyrinth where Costello escapes. Costello thus seeks to get paid for Costello's killing job and get revenge on the shadowy businessman who hired Costello, and stay one step ahead of the police Inspector but makes a decision that brings about surprising results.
